WARNING/CAUTION/NOTE

Indicates a potential hazard that could result in death or injury.

Indicates a potential hazard that could result in motorcycle damage.

NOTE: Indicates special information to make maintenance easier or instructions clearer.

Please read this manual and follow its instructions carefully. To emphasize special information, the

symbol and the words WARNING,CAUTION and NOTE have special meanings. Pay special attention to

the messages highlighted by these signal words.

Please note, however, that the warnings and the cautions contained in this manual cannot possibly cover

all potential hazards relating to the servicing, or lack of servicing of the motorcycle. In addition to the

WARNING and CAUTION stated, you must use good judgment and basic mechanical safety principles. If

you are unsure about how to perform a particular service operation, ask a more experienced technician for

advice.

Proper service and repair procedures are important for the safety of the service technician and the

safety and reliability of the motorcycle.

When 2 or more persons work together, pay attention to safety of each other.

When it is necessary to run the engine indoors, make sure that exhaust gas is forced outdoor.

When working with the toxic or flammable materials, make sure that the area you work in is well ventilated and that you follow all of the material manufacturer's instructions.

Never use gasoline as a cleaning solvent.

NOTE: If parts replacement is necessary, replace the parts with SUZUKI GENUINE PARTS or their

equivalent.

When removing parts that are to be reused, keep them arranged in an orderly manner so that they

may be reinstalled in the proper order and orientation.

Be sure to use special tools when instructed.

Make sure that all parts used in reassembly are clean, and also lubricated when specified.

When use of a certain type of lubricant, bond, or sealant is specified, be sure to use the specified

type.

When performing service to electrical parts, if the service procedures not require used of battery

power, disconnect the positive terminal.

When removing the battery, disconnect the negative cable first and then the positive cable.

When reconnecting the battery, connect the positive cable first and then the negative cable, and

replace the terminal cover on the positive terminal.

Tighten cylinder head and case bolts and nuts, beginning with larger diameter and ending with

smaller diameter, from inside to outside diagonally, to the specified tightening torque.

Whenever you remove oil seals, gaskets, packing, O-rings, locking washers, cotter pins, cir-clips,

and certain other parts as specified, be sure to replace them with new ones. Also, before installing

these new parts, be sure to remove any odd material from the mating surfaces.

Never reuse a circlip. When installing a new circlip, take care not to expend the end gap larger than

required to slip the circlip over the shaft. After installing a circlip, always ensure that it is completely

seated in its groove and securely fitted.

Do not use self-locking nuts a few times over.

Use a torque wrench to tighten fasteners to the torque values when specified. Wipe off grease or oil

if a thread is smeared with them.

After reassembly, check parts for tightness and operation.

To protect environment, do not unlawfully dispose of used motor oil and other fluids,

batteries and tires.

To protect earth's natural resources, properly dispose of used motorcycles and parts.

BREAK-IN PROCEDURE

During the manufacture only the best

are used and all machined parts are

finished to a very high standard

allow the moving part to “BREAK-IN”

its early life

The general rules are as follows: p

. The

future performance and reliability of the engine

depend

The throttle must not be opened to the full during

the new motorcycle's break-in period. Throttle

pening should be limited to less than 3/4 of its

maximum, while violent acceleration should be

avoided.

Do

not

maintain

constant

engine

gear

and

speed for an extended time period during any

portion of the break-in. Try to vary the throttle

position. During the period of break-in, increase

the throttle opening properly to enable break-in

fully.

When engine is running at constant low speed

(low load), parts will wear rapidly leads to bad

brake-in.

Specification and classification: DOT 3 or DOT 4

The brake system of this motorcycle is filled with a

glycol-based brake fluid. Do not use or mix different

types of fluid such as silicone-based or pertroieum based. Do not use any brake fluid taken from old, used

r unsealed containers. Never re-use brake fluid left

ver from the last servicing or stored for a long period.

Brake fluid is harmful or fatal if swallowed, and harmful

if it comes in contact with skin or eyes. If brake fluid is

swallowed,

immediately

contact

poison

control

center or a physician. If brake fluid gets in eyes, flush

eyes with water and seek medical attention. Do not

wash the master cylinder with high pressure water.

Check the thickness

f front brake disc, replace the front

brake disc with new one if the thickness is less than 3.5mm.

The extent of brake pad wear can be checked by observing the

grooved limit line

n the pad. When the wear exceeds the

grooved limit line, replace the pads with new ones.

Do not drive the motorcycle immediately after the

replacement of the new brake disc or brake pads.

Squeeze and release the brake lever several times to

make the mating of

brake disc and brake pads

completely and circulation of brake fluid stably. The

brake distance is longer than the original distance

after the replacement of new brake disc or brake pads.

After 300 km of driving, the motorcycle will get the

best break performance. Before that, Keeping enough

brake distance is necessary during the driving.

Support the motorcycle body on the center stand, and place

the handlebars straight.

Check the brake fluid level by observing the lower level line

n the brake fluid reservoir.

When the level is below the lower level line, replenish with

brake fluid that meets the following specification.

Handle the brake fluid with care: the fluid reacts

chemically with paint, plastics, rubber materials, etc.

Replenish the brake fluid reservoir as necessary while

bleeding the brake system. Make sure that there is

always some fluid visible in the reservoir.

Air trapped in the fluid circuit acts like a cushion to absorb a

large proportion of the pressure developed by the master

cylinder and thus interferes with the full braking performance

f the caliper brake. The presence of air is indicated by

"sponginess" of the brake lever and also by lack of braking

force. Considering the danger to which such trapped air

exposes the machine and rider, it is essential that, after

remounting the brake and restoring the brake system to the

normal condition, the brake fluid circuit be purged of air in the

following manner: Fill up the master cylinder reservoir to the upper line.

Replace the reservoir cap to prevent entry of dirt.

Attach a pipe to the caliper bleeder valve, and insert the free

end of the pipe into a receptacle.

Squeeze and release the brake lever several times in rapid

succession, and squeeze the lever fully without releasing it.

Loosen the bleeder valve by turning it a quarter of a turn so

that the brake fluid runs into the receptacle; this will remove

the tension of the brake lever causing it to touch the

handlebar grip. Then close the valve, pump and squeeze the

lever, and open the valve.

Repeat this process until the fluid flowing into the receptacle

no longer contains air bubbles.

Close the bleeder valve, and disconnect the pipe. Fill the

reservoir to the "upper” level line.

Squeeze the front brake lever to inspect the brake light switch.

If the brake light switch works inflexible, inspect, adjust or

replace.

Steering stem bearings should be adjusted properly for smooth

turning of the handlebars and safe running.

Steering which is too stiff prevents smooth movement of

handlebar.

Steering which is too loose will cause vibration and damage to

the steering bearing. Check to see that there is no play in the

front fork attachment.

If the play is found, perform the steering bearing adjustment as

described in page 5-16 of this manual.

Inspect every 5 000 km.

The camshaft should be checked for runout and also for

wear of cams and journals if the engine has been noted

to produce abnormal noise or vibration or a lack of output

power.

Worn-down cams are often the cause of mistimed valve

wear is specified for both intake and exhaust cams in terms of

cam height

, which is to be measured with a micrometer.

Replace camshafts if found it worn down to the limit.

Determine whether each journal is worn down to the limit or

not by measuring camshaft journal oil clearance with the

camshaft installed.

Use the plastigage to read the clearance at the widest

portion, install the cylinder head cover and tighten the

cylinder head cover bolts to the specified torque.

Remove the cylinder head cover and measure the width of

the compressed plastigage using the envelope scale. This

measurement should be taken at the widest part of the

The brake system of this motorcycle is filled with a Suzuki brake fluid. Do not use or mix

different types of fuid such as silicone-based and petroleum-based fluid for refilling the

system, otherwise serious damage will be caused.

Do not use any brake fluid taken from old or used or unsealed containers. Never re-use the

brake fluid left over from the last servicing and stored for long periods.

When storing the brake fluid, seal the container completely and keep away from children.

When replenishing brake fluid, take care not to get dust into fluid.

When washing brake components, use new brake fluid. Never use cleaning solvent.

A contaminated brake disc or brake pad reduces braking performance. Discard contaminated

pads and clean the disc with high quality brake cleaner or neutral detergent.

Battery

Breathe

pipe

6-15

Filling electrolyte

Remove the short sealed tube before filling electrolyte. Fill

battery with electrolyte (dilute sulfuric acid solution with acid

concentration of 35.0% by weight, having a specific gravity of

1.28 at 20 C/86 F) up to indicated UPPER LEVEL. Filling

electroltye should be always cooled below 20 C/86 F before

filing into battery

Leave battery standing for half an hour

after filing. Add additional electrolyte if necessary.

Charge battery with current as described in the tables shown

below.

Standard Charging current

0.7 A

In fitting the battery to the motorcycle, connect the breather

tube to the battery vent.

Servicing

Months after manufacturing

6-12

Over 12

Necessary charging hours

Visually inspect the surface of the battery container. If any signs

f cracking or electrolyte leakage from the sides of the battery

have occurred, replace the battery with a new one.

If the battery terminals are found to be coated with rust or an

acidic white powdery substance, then this can be cleaned away

with sandpaper.

The charging time for a new battery is determined by the number

f months that have elapsed since the date of manufacture.

Near the end of charging period, adjust the specific gravity of

electrolyte

to

value

specified. After

charging,

adjust

the

electrolyte level to the UPPER LEVEL with DISTILLED WATER.

Downloaded from www.Manualslib.com manuals search engine

6-16

Check the electrolyte level and add distilled water, as

necessary, to raise the electrolyte to each cell’s upper level.

Check the battery for proper charge by taking an electrolyte

S.G. reading. If the reading is 1.22 or less, as corrected to

20 C, it means that the battery is still in a run-down condition

and needs recharging.

Disconnect the

lead first

BASED ON S.G. READING

To read the S G

n the hydrometer, bring the electrolyte

in the hydrometer to eye level and read the graduations on

the float scale bordering on the meniscus(curved-up portion

f electroylte) as shown in figure.

Check the reading (as corrected to 20 C) with chart to

determine the recharging time in hours by constant-current

charging at a charging rate of 0.7A.

Be careful not to permit the electrolyte temperature to

exceed 45 C, at any time during the recharging operation.

Interrupt the operation, as necessary, to let the electrolyte

cool down. Recharge the battery to the specification.

Constant-voltage charging, otherwise called “quick”

charging, is not recommendable for it could shorten the

life of the battery.

Before charging a battery, remove the seal cap from each

cell.

Keep fire and sparks away from a battery being charged.

When removing a battery from the motorcycle, be sure to

remove the

terminal first.
